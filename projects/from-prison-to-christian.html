        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          It is a passion of mine to film people's testimonies as
          a witnessing tool to show the power of Christ to transform
          a soul no matter what lifestyle or experience they have been
          through. Prison was the last place Marcus Williams thought he
          would find God. His life revolved around the drug scene and
          the fast paced lifestyle that came with it but in spite of the
          activities of his life, God found a way to knock on the door
          of his heart and show him a purpose for his life that was
          bigger than he had ever imagined. This life testimony was
          filmed on location in Wolverhampton UK close to where Marcus
          grew up and lives.
