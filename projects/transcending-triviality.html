      <p>
        AYC is doing something gutsy in 2014.  They are launching an
        evangelistic thrust across the continent of Australia.  I was so
        humbled to be apart of this re:volution convention as one of its
        speakers.  As a part of my speaking responsibilities, Christiana
        informed me of the need to write an article for the South
        Pacific Division magazine.  Always honored to share with God's
        people and promote the dedication of so many involved in AYC,
        I wrote it about Daniel.
