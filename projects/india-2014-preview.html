        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          When we look at the life of Jesus, we see perfectly
          symmetrical ministry: teaching in their synagogues, preaching
          the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all illnesses and
          diseases among the people.<br>
          Seven twenty-somethings gathered from four countries to mirror
          this ministry of Christ in Pune, India. Hearts were knit with
          Christ and His people; first Bibles were given, cherished, and
          read; hearts were touched with the practical love of Christ;
          bodies were healed by the Great Physician; missionaries
          learned that success is always dependent on prayer.<br>
          We are grateful. We are inspired. We are encouraged. We are
          longing to return and continue. Here is but a taste.
