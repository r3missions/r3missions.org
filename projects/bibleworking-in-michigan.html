        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          After canvassing with ExCEL in summer of 2011, the Michigan
          Conference hired me to Biblework with both Detroit Metro SDA
          church and the ExCEL program. Using the Bible study interests
          gathered by the canvassers, I Bibleworked all across
          southeastern Michigan. I worked with Pastor Jim Howard and
          Pastor Joe Reeves, who mentored me, supplied my Bible study
          literature, and oversaw the integration of the incoming Bible
          worker after I left. I also served as a ground leader of the
          ExCEL program several times a week, gave devotional talks for
          and mentored the canvassers.
