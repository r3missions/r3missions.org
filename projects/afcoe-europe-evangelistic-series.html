        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          This summer, I was honored to join to AFOCE-Europe program and
          the Von Maurs in Darmstadt, Germany for a course on Campus
          Ministries and an Evangelistic Series in the evening.  The
          series was an apologetic approach to serious questions that
          many in the secular world have.  I was thankful to meet with
          an asian student one afternoon regarding hell and what happens
          after death.  The clarity warmed his soul and he began
          inviting his friends to the series.  Candis also sang the
          appeal songs in the evening which everyone broke out their
          smartphones to record. Powerful experience.
