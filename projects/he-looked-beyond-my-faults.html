        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          “It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in
          contemplation of the life of Christ. We should take it point
          by point, and let the imagination grasp each scene, especially
          the closing ones. As we thus dwell upon His great sacrifice
          for us, our confidence in Him will be more constant, our love
          will be quickened, and we shall be more deeply imbued with His
          spirit.”—Desire of Ages, p. 83<br>
          May this song be a vehicle, ushering you into such a time of reflection.
          <br>—Candis Braxton
