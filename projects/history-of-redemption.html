      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        Beneath the surface of Lucifer’s claim, that God is unfair and
        unjust, was his resistance and refusal to accept Christ as being
        God Himself. He wanted the glory that God the Father was giving
        to God the Son. Beneath the surface, the divinity of Christ was
        in question. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The History of Redemption, the study of past events pertaining
        to the redemption of man, is the stage upon which the character
        of Satan, God the Father, and Christ become clear. God is fair,
        God is just and Christ is even more deserving of His glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This controversy began long ago in the courts of heaven and
        today rages in our hearts. Before men and angels, a decision
        must be made. To whom will you give your whole heart? 
      </p>
      <p>
        This concert, a combination of scripture, powerful quotes from
        Christian authors, and song, is designed to call its listeners
        to a decision.  What will you do with Jesus?

    <p><strong>Candis Braxton</strong> is a mother of two and a wife of one. After being asked to sing for an evangelistic series while a freshman in college, she decided to give her life to Christ. “I sang the appeal song every night which meant I had to listen to all 14 messages. Everyone was shocked when I answered the call for baptism. I think they all thought I was already a member of the SDA church but I wasn’t.” Since making that decision she has also committed to using her voice to share the gospel of Christ.</p>

  <div class="two-thirds column">
    <p><strong>Chayah Miranda</strong> (kai-yah) is a Christian Pop artist, best known for her sweet yet powerful voice. Performing all over the U.S., and throughout her native San Francisco Bay Area, she has won numerous awards for her vocals as well as her songwriting.</p>
    <p>Before becoming a Christian artist, Chayah had her mind set on becoming a Pop R&amp;B artist. While attending Berklee College of Music where she studied voice and performance, Chayah faced many obstacles and trials that brought her to reflect on what mattered most in her life. It was in early 2010 when she had to fight for her life and found herself praying to God for healing. Faithfully as God would have it, Chayah felt God's love and healing power. It was in that moment when she fully surrendered her life to Christ and made the decision to follow Jesus. Chayah has continued to follow Jesus and in doing so, she found her true calling...to serve God through her music and to spread the Gospel of good news to all who don't know Christ.</p>
    <p>Chayah’s debut full-length album “No Other Way,” recorded in Nashville with producer Josh Robinson—who has worked with Britt Nicole, Brandon Heath, and Natalie Grant—will be released March 2014. The first single “Higher” off of this upcoming album is now available on iTunes.</p>
