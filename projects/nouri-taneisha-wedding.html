        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          In Manchester 2013, I had the opportunity to film the Wedding
          of Nouri and Taneisha. For such an important day as this and
          one that goes by so fast, it was essential that I captured
          everything they could treasure as memories of their special
          day. From beginning to end it was clear to see that God's
          blessing rested on this union and being a part of documenting
          that was a privilege.
