        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          300 children would have gone hungry that day if it wasn't for
          a praying man.  1 million souls would have never been brought
          to Christ if it wasn't for a praying man.  We are living in
          a time when our greatest need, I believe, is for a praying
          man.  We have plenty of educated men.  We have plenty of
          wealthy men.  We have plenty of influential men.  We have
          plenty of musical men.  But there is a man that is often
          underestimated and under appreciated.  The man of all men who
          yields greater power and greater results than all the
          educated, wealthy, influential, and musical men combined.
          That is a praying man.
