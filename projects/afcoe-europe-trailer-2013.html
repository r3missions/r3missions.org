        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          This trailer was created to promote the start of an Amazing
          Facts School of Evangelism in the heart of Europe. This school
          in Germany was started with the aim of reigniting the fire of
          the Reformation by providing training to individuals who
          desired to dedicate their time and energy to the spreading of
          the Gospel in Europe.
