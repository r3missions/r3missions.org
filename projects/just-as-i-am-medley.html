        <p>
          This medley encapsulates the Christian’s experience in its
          beginning as well as when we are seeking spiritual renewal.
          Compelled by the desire to be a Christian, we come as we are to
          Jesus; and when we see Him, our prayer is to be like Him, and
          this can only be accomplished by surrendering all to Him.
          <br>—Candis Braxton
