        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          I was asked to create this trailer by Pastor Ivor Myers as
          part of a series of trailers to advertise the Central
          Californian Conference mission to the cities project in San
          Francisco, USA. The series of trailers was designed to give
          information in snippets to generate interest and build
          anticipation for their upcoming mission project.
