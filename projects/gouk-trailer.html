        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          Go UK is a London Youth Federation weekend training that takes
          the form of a Youth Camp meeting based around evangelism and
          celebrating Youth Work. This trailer was commissioned by the
          LYF and South England Conference to advertise the re-launch of
          this conference in October 2014.
