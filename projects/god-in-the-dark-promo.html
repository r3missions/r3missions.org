        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          The world is filled with ideas about God. To a sincere seeker,
          it can all seem deafening and even confusing to navigate
          through. How did God become so shrouded in mystery? Why
          doesn't He make His presence more obvious? Especially during
          difficult times of human life? Why is God in the dark? Come
          and see God step into the light that He may be seen for who He
          really is.
          <br>â€”Sebastien Braxton, Clive Coutet
