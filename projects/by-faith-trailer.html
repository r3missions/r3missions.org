              <h3>Project Description</h3>
              <p>
                At GYC Louisville in 2009, I was approached by a good
                friend of mine, Foley Ibidapo, who worked with Affiliate
                Media at the time.  He had planned to do
                a mini-documentary on a young man who backed out last
                minute.  With the equipment present and the most
                influential adventist youth convention on the horizon,
                he asked if he could follow me around while speaking,
                living, and ministering.  Afterwards, a concept emerged
                in regards to preaching being an act of faith.  It was
                wonderful collaborating with Foley and the AFM team.
