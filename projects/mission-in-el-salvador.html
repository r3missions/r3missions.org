      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        A week before the mission flight to El Salvador, I was
        approached by the chaplain of Shenandoah Valley Academy to join.
        A student had backed out, leaving the chaplain with a fully paid
        ticket, and he urged me to come as a leader and translator.
        After arriving in San Juan Opico, I taught 3-6 grades Math and
        English throughout the week at ECAS. I spoke for Sabbath Divine
        Service at the end of our week of prayer, and I helped teach
        high school Bible class. Most memorable, I was able to form
        meaningful relationships with the locals and witness God work in
        and through us.
