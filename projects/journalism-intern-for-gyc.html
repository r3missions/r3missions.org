        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          In December 2011, Michel Lee the Vice President of Resources
          asked me to join her team for GYC. I began with editing
          articles, program booklets, and the like. After the first GYC
          Europe, I started writing more articles and coordinating with
          wider networks to publish abroad the powerful things God was
          (and still is) doing through GYC. After covering the Seattle
          GYC conference, a non-denominational Christian magazine,
          Rejuvenate, contacted GYC to republish a reflective article of
          mine. I also loved working with Tamyra Horst to cover the GYC
          INTERmission in Allentown, PA in June 2013. This coming year,
          I will be mentoring new journalism interns.
