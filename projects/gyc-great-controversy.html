      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        GYC has always and continues to present the most influential
        youth event in the global Adventist church.  But GYC also goes
        beyond the conference into missions into unentered areas,
        evangelism seminars, and even a conference in Europe.  One of
        the recent projects regards the Great Controversy.  This book
        singlehandedly brought me from staunch disregard for
        Christianity to a daily submission to its principles, purpose
        and person.  Michel Lee, GYC Vice-President Resources asked me
        to help write a back cover summary for such a momentous work.
        After a couple drafts and conversations, this what we ended
        with.  I also like Brandon Schroeder's design for the cover. Get
