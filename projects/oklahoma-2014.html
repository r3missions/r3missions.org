        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          1 year ago, Moore, Oklahoma was devastated by an immense
          tornado that left large portions of its community in shambles.
          However, several organizations and churches stepped up to
          meet the enormous need.  Hope Adventist Fellowship Church kept
          their disaster relief going longer than most in the city.
          R3 teamed up with the Hope Church to continue bringing hope
          and encouragement to those still recovering in the Moore
          community.
