        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          I was approached by the leaders of the men's ministry
          InstruMENtal, to document their 2013 retreat at Eastwood Hall,
          Nottingham, UK. This video is a glimpse into what took place
          at that retreat and serves as a promotion for future events as
          well as being a great reminder of lessons learnt and decisions
          made to those who attended.
