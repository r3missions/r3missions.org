        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          In August this year, Sebastien Braxton and Clive Coutet, the
          President and R3 Media Director, joined the Karengata SDA church
          for its annual camp meeting. It was a powerful and life changing
          experience for the R3 team, the Karengata SDA Church, the
          Victory SDA Choir, and the community of Nairobi. It was
          wonderful to end the camp meeting with the baptism and
          re-baptism of several youth and young adults.
          <br>â€”Sebastien Braxton, Clive Coutet
